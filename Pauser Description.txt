Project Description
This program is designed to control video playback using the Pause/Break key (located above the PgUp key). It allows you to pause and resume videos by pressing this key.

Features:

•Works with the last opened video, regardless of the active window.
•Supports background operation, enabling you to perform other tasks while the program runs.
•Allows control of video playback even if the video is open on a different monitor.
•Works smoothly in most games; for specific games like DayZ, the program needs to be run as an administrator.
•Currently, the Pause/Break key cannot be reassigned, but this feature will be added in future updates.
