# Pauser

This program is designed to control video playback using the Pause/Break key (located above the PgUp key). It allows you to pause and resume videos by pressing this key.

Features:

â€¢Works with the last opened video, regardless of the active window.

â€¢Supports background operation, enabling you to perform other tasks while the program runs.

â€¢Allows control of video playback even if the video is open on a different monitor.

â€¢Works smoothly in most games; for specific games like DayZ, the program needs to be run as an administrator.

â€¢Currently, the Pause/Break key cannot be reassigned, but this feature will be added in future updates.
